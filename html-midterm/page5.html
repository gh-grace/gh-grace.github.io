    <h1> Changelog</h1>

    <h2> Page 1 </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Before the head tag, there is an html tag. In this document, there was only html, so inside it, I included lang="en".</li>
        <li>In the head, meta charset="UTF-8" was missing, and so, I included it.</li>
        <li>Additionally, in the head, I added meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge". 
            This is not a regular line of code that appears in the head, but was present in other pages, and so I included it as well.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, in the head, meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" was missing, and so, I also included it.</li>
        <li>In the body of the document, 'Item 3' is in a list, but it did not have an end tag, /li, so I included it.</li>
        <li>Along with the missing /li tag, the paragraph were 'This div contains a nested paragraph' was also missing a closing tag. 
            Therefore I included /p.</li>      
        <li>At the end of 'Cell 3' a closing tag /td was also missing. 
            Therefore, /td was also added.</li>  
        <li>In the given document, the image was 'broken' and not displaying. 
            This is because the image file was not in the same directory as the page1.html. 
            To corrent this, the relative link was fixed to state 'img/image.png'.</li>
        <li>To improve the visuality of the page, instead of the absolute example link appearing to the right of the image, I added the code of the link inside a paragraph tag to appear below the image.</li>    
        <li>Inside the table tags, there are two nested tr tags. 
            One of the tr ending tags was missing. 
            To correct it, /tr was added.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, in the table tag, a closing was missing, so /table was added.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Page 2 </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Although it is not an error, I relocated the source page link to below the 'New Beehive Inn' header so that the user could easily see where the source is from, instead of having it linked close to the navigation bar.</li>
        <li>In the given document, there was an attempt to bold 'New Beehive Inn.' 
            There were carrots, but inside the carrots, /b, was missing, unable to actually bold the text. 
            Therefore, /b was added.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, with the interior heading, I switched h2 and b to bold the header. 
            Previously, the header tag was inside the bold tag, which did not work correctly.</li>
        <li>There is a broken link for bay. 
            To correct the link so that it goes to a bay wikipedia page, I replaced the broken link with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(architecture).</li>
        <li>To improve consistency and the visuality of the webpage, I added hr below 'Interior' header.</li>
        <li>In the document, there was a missing link for segmental arch. 
            To correct this error, I went to the source and clicked on the segmental arch to get an absolute link, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmental_arch.</li>
        <li>Another error in the document was that a closing tag was missing in the 'History' header. 
            Therefore, the closing tag /h6 was added to the end of 'History'.</li>
        <li>As well as adding a hr below the 'Interior' header, it was also added below the 'Closure' header.</li>
        <li>Finally, to make the page look more consistent, I ensured that all headers, but the first one was changed to h2.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Page 3 </h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>In any html document,the first line of code should be !DOCTYPE html. 
            This was missing, and so, it was added.</li>
        <li>Right after the !DOCTYPE html, should be an html tag. 
            There was an html tag, but lang="en" was missing. 
            Therefore, lang="en" was added to the html tag.</li>
        <li>In the head, meta charset="UTF-8" was missing, which was also added.</li>
        <li>Another missing feature to the head was 'meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"'. 
            As this line of code was in the other pages, I also included it in page 4.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, along with the missing added meta charset, a meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" was missing, but added.</li>
        <li>In the head, the title of the document was just 'Page 3'.
            To make the title more consistent with all the other pages, I renamed it to 'Mid-term Page 3'.</li>
        <li>added link rel="stylesheet" href="cars.css"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Page 4 </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Similar to page 4, !DOCTYPE html was missing. 
            Therefore, I included it as the first line of code.</li>
        <li>Additionally, like other pages, I added 'Mid-term' into the title.</li>
        <li>In the body, there was a missing closing tag. 
            Thus, /td was added after 'img src="img/dogSinging.png"'.</li>
        <li>Instead of missing a closing tag, an opening tag was missing for the image of a creature. 
            Therefore, td was added before 'img src="img/creature.png"'.</li>
        <li>As opposed to missing an opening or closing tag, a td tag was missing for the orage cat. 
            To ensure that the orange cat could appear, an opening td and closing td tag was added to 'img src="img/orangeCat.png"'.</li>
        <li>Another correction that was done was adding an alt text to all the image source so that peoplel who need to use a screen reader can still understand what images are on the page.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, the table that was originallly shown grouped and arranged similar photos (dogs, cats, others), horizontally. 
            However, it did not match the table header. 
            To correct this issue, I rearranged every image inside the nested tr tags so that all the dog photos are under dog, cat photos under cat, and all the other photos under other.</li>
    </ul>
